## Questions

* Why learn Angular JS over other frameworks like Ember, Backbone, Knockout, etc?

Angular is lighter than the others (when you include dependencies), has a larger community, has two way data binding, and
was designed with testing in mind.

* People have some very strong opinions about Angular. What are 3 common complaints people have about Angular?

it can be too powerful (you can write logic in the view, which makes it harder to test), scope hierarchy can be confusing to new
developers, the complexity of the directives API can be confusing, and if you have more than 2000 active bindings on a page it can be slow.  

* Is Angular an MVC framework?

yes.

* Turn to the Angular docs. Find `ng-app`. What is it and what does it do? What does `ng` stand for?

ng-app is the root module for angular, and it causes the page to auto-bootstrap. ng stands for Angular.
